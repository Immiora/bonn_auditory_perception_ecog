### Brain-optimized neural network for auditory processing

Here we construct a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features. In the associated paper we show that it could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses.

The repository contains

- the model specification using [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) 6.1.0
- the training routine
- the weights of one of the best performing models
