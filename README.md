### Brain-optimized neural network for auditory processing

The repository provides code that supports the results reported here: 

[Brain-optimized extraction of complex sound features that drive continuous auditory perception](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007992)<br /> by Berezutskaya J., Freudenburg Z.V., Güçlü U., van Gerven M.A.J. & Ramsey N.F. in *PLOS Computational Biology*, 2020

Here we construct a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features. In the associated paper we show that it could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses.

The repository contains

- the model specification using [Chainer](https://chainer.org/) 6.1.0
- the training routine
- the weights of one of the best performing models
